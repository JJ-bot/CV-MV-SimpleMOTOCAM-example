Hello! This is just an example for my diploma work on field of robotics. It is based on SimpleCV and Python.

You will need to download a SimpleCV platform for python2.7.x (I tested it on 2.7.3 and 2.7.6). The official site is: http://simplecv.org/download/ or from github: https://github.com/sightmachine/SimpleCV
